Searching the void for “code void”, top hit, [Stack Overflow](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=code+void&ia=qa&iax=qa):

## [What does void mean in C, C++, and C#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1043034/ddg#1043107)

> Basically it means “nothing” or “no type”

> There are 3 basic ways that void is used:

> Function argument: `int myFunc(void)` — the function takes nothing.

> Function return value: `void myFunc(int)` — the function returns nothing

> Generic data pointer: `void* data` — ‘data’ is a pointer to data of unknown type, and cannot be dereferenced

> Note: the `void` in a function argument is optional in C++, so `int myFunc()` is exactly the same as `int myFunc(void)`, and it is left out completely in C#. It is always required for a return value.
